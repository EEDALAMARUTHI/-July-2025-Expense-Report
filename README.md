# Insights

ðŸ§¨Spending was highly concentrated on a few days, suggesting bulk or one-time payments rather than consistent daily expenses.

Most days had small, consistent spends (â‚¹10â€“â‚¹50), indicating regular daily or minor transactions.

Days with 3+ transactions: 04-Jul, 06-Jul, 08-Jul, 16-Jul, 28-Jul, 30-Jul â€” likely busy or high-expense days.

# Insights

The Hostel fee accounts for the majority of your spending, making up over half (53.41%) of total expenses, despite being a single transaction.â€‹

Gym expenses are the second-highest at 10.68% of total spending, also from a single transaction.â€‹

Categories like Fruits, Electronics, Biryani, Cake, and Groceries follow, but each contributes less than 6% to overall expense individually.

Most of your spending happens in the morning, accounting for over two-thirds of your expenses, while night, afternoon, and evening contribute much smaller shares. This means that large or critical payments typically occur early in the day, so financial planning should focus on morning transactions for better control and savings opportunities.
